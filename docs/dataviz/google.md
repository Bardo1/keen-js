# Google Charts Dataviz Adapter

Google Charts is currently the default visualization library for this SDK, and is loaded automatically from Google's JSAPI.

Custom date formatting is possible by bypassing the `.render()` function and interacting with Google Charts library directly, as demonstrated in this [jsFiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/keen/bq6rovjd/).

Supported chart types and links to their configuration options are available [here](../visualization.md).
